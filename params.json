It's still in the very early stages of development, so expect the content to change a great deal in the future.\r\n\r\n### installing and loading the package\r\n\r\nTo install the package from github you first need to install and load Hadley Wickham's [devtools package][devtools], like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninstall.packages('devtools')\r\nlibrary(devtools)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen use the `install_github` function\r\n\r\n```\r\ninstall_github('movement', 'SEEG-Oxford')\r\n```\r\n\r\nand load the package and you're ready to go\r\n\r\n```\r\nlibrary(movement)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nThe most common use of the package is to parameterize a movement model based on observed population movements, and then use this model to predict _de novo_ population movements.\r\n\r\n```\r\nm <- movement(locations = df_locations$location, coords = df_locations[, c('lon','lat')], population = df_locations$pop, movement_matrix = observed, model = 'radiation with selection')\r\n```\r\nWhere df_locations is a data.frame containing location, lon, lat and pop columns corresponding to location ids, coordinates and populations respectively. movement_matrix is a square matrix of observed population movements between the location_ids, and model is the selected movement model (valid models are radiation with selection, original radiation, gravity, intervening opportunities and uniform selection).\r\n\r\nThis returns an optimisedmodel object which can be used by predict() to predict population movements from a RasterLayer, or a dataframe formatted as df_locations above.\r\n\r\n```\r\nprediction <- predict(m, raster)\r\nprediction <- predict(m, df_locations)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Contributors\r\n\r\n[Nick Golding][Nick] @ [Spatial Ecology and Epidemiology Group, Oxford][seeg]\r\n\r\nAndrew Schofield @ [Tessella][tessella]\r\n\r\n### Reporting Bugs\r\n\r\nYou can report bugs, issues and suggestions for extra functions using the issues button on the right hand side of this page.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Nick]: http://www.map.ox.ac.uk/about-map/map-team/nicholas-golding/\r\n[seeg]: http://simonhay.zoo.ox.ac.uk/staff.php\r\n[devtools]: http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html\r\n[tessella]: http://www.tessella.com/\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
